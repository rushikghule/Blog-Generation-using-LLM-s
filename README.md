# Blog Generation using Large Language Models

This project aims to generate blog posts using Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-3.5. The generated content can be used for various purposes such as content generation for websites, filling in missing sections in articles, or even generating ideas for blog posts.

## Features

- **LLM-based Generation**: Utilizes state-of-the-art Large Language Models for generating blog content.
- **Customization**: The model will be fine-tuned on specific datasets or tailored to generate content in a particular style or domain.
- **Easy-to-use Interface**: Simple interface for generating blog posts with minimal input requirements using streamlit.

## Requirements

- Python 3.9
- Dependencies listed in 'requirements.txt'

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/rushikghule/Blog-Generation-using-LLM-s.git
    ```

2. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. **Generating Blog Posts**: Run the `app.py` script with appropriate arguments to generate a blog post. For example:

    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py 
    ```
